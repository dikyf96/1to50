Here's a step-by-step pseudocode to solve the game using an automated test:

Start the WebDriver: Initialize the WebDriver and open the game URL.

Scroll the page: Calculate the total height of the page and scroll to a quarter of the page. This is done to ensure that the game elements are in the view of the browser.

Click the buttons: Loop from 1 to 50 (as the game requires clicking buttons from 1 to 50 in order). For each number:

Wait until the button with the current number is clickable. This is done using WebDriverWait and the expected condition element_to_be_clickable.
Click the button.
Optionally, wait for a short period of time before proceeding to the next button. This can be done using time.sleep.
Handle exceptions: If at any point an exception occurs (for example, if a button is not found or is not clickable), catch the exception and print an error message. This is done using a try/except block.

End the test: After all buttons have been clicked, the test is complete. The WebDriver can be closed or left open, depending on your needs.

This pseudocode corresponds closely to the Python code you provided. The main function main() follows this pseudocode, with the additional functions launch(), clickbutton(), getElementByXpathOrWait(), and waitInseconds() providing the necessary functionality for each step.
